## Reporting a Vulnerability
We take security seriously and appreciate contributions that help improve our project. If you discover a vulnerability, please report it responsibly by emailing [subinoyberadgp@gmail.com](mailto:subinoyberadgp@gmail.com).

### Information to Include:
- *Description:* Detailed explanation of the vulnerability.
- *Steps to Reproduce:* Clear steps to replicate the issue.
- *Impact Assessment:* Potential risk and scope (data leakage, model bias, etc.).
- *Environment Details:* Version number, system details, and any configurations involved.

We aim to acknowledge receipt of all vulnerability reports within *48 hours* and resolve critical issues within *14 days*. For non-critical issues, resolution time may vary based on complexity.

## Key Security Practices

### 1. *Logging and Monitoring:*
   - *Secure Logging:* Logs are stored securely with restricted access.
   - *Activity Monitoring:* Continuous monitoring for suspicious activity or unauthorized access.

### 2. *Adversarial Attack Mitigation:*
   - *Input Validation:* Ensures inputs conform to expected formats to prevent adversarial attacks.
   - *Adversarial Detection:* Basic defense mechanisms to detect anomalies or adversarial patterns.
   - *Robust Training:* Models are trained with adversarial robustness techniques to handle edge cases.

### 3. *Dependency and Code Management:*
   - *Dependency Scans:* Regular scans to identify and patch vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
   - *Version Locking:* Dependencies are locked using requirements.txt to avoid unintended updates.
   - *Code Reviews:* All code changes are peer-reviewed to maintain code quality and security.

### 4. *Deployment Security:*
   - *Container Security:* If using containers, ensure images are scanned for vulnerabilities.
   - *Environment Isolation:* Separate environments for development, testing, and production.
   - *Secrets Management:* Sensitive keys and secrets are stored securely (e.g., using environment variables or vault solutions).

## Disclosure Policy
We believe in responsible disclosure. Once a vulnerability is reported:
1. We will validate and acknowledge the report.
2. The reporter will be kept updated on the status of the fix.
3. A public disclosure may be made only after the issue is resolved to prevent exploitation.

Thank you for helping to maintain the security of the project. Your contributions make a significant difference!
